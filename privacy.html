                        continue to process or store it;</p>

                    <p>CalOPPA requires commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy.
                    The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company
                        in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites
                        collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers,
                        to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the
                        information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is
                        being shared. See more at:

                    <br>
                    <p>According to CalOPPA, RevTech agrees to the following:</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Once this Privacy Policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page or on the first
                        significant page after entering the Platform.</p>
                    <p>RevTech’s Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy' and can easily be found on each page
                        on the Platform.</p>
                    <p>You can request to change your Personal Information by emailing us at:

                    <h3><b>CAN SPAM Act</b></h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>The CAN-SPAM Act is a Federal US law that sets the rules for commercial email,
                        establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right
                        to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out strict penalties
                        for violations.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>To be in accordance with CANSPAM, RevTech agrees to the following:</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Not use false or misleading subjects or email addresses.</p>
                    <p>Identify the commercial message sent to you as an advertisement when required.</p>
                    <p>Include the physical address of our business or site headquarters.</p>
                    <p>Monitor third-party email marketing services for compliance, if one is used.</p>
                    <p>Honor opt-out/unsubscribe requests quickly.</p>
                    <p>Allow users to unsubscribe by using the link at the bottom of each email.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails,
                        you can email us at info@RevTechltd.com.and we will promptly remove you from
                        ALL correspondence.</p>
